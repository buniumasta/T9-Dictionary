# T9-Dictionary

***A long, long time ago, before the touchscreen keyboards of modern phones, primitive beings called humans typed words on their flip phones using numeric keypads. "How does this work?" you wonder. "Numbers aren't letters!" Indeed, they are not; however, each numeric key was marked with a collection of letters it could represent.***
